# Section 1: Basic Concepts: The Observation Paradox and Informational Existence

## 1.1 Theoretical Background of "It Doesn't Exist Unless Observed"

### The Extension Principle from Quantum to Macroscopic World

The "Observation Paradox" in our work extends the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to macroscopic scales. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce three basic premises:

#### First Premise: Universality of Informational Interaction
Every entity in the universe transmits and receives information in some form. This information exchange is the essential condition for "existence."

```
Basic Equation of Existence:
E(existence) = I(information transmission) × R(information reception) × T(temporal continuity)
```

#### Second Premise: Hierarchical Structure of Observation
Observation is not a simple binary state (observed/not observed) but has the following hierarchy:

1. **Zeroth-order observation**: Unconscious, automatic physical interactions (gravity, electromagnetic waves, etc.)
2. **First-order observation**: Conscious but passive observation (seeing, hearing, etc.)
3. **Second-order observation**: Active measurement and recording (scientific observation)
4. **Third-order observation**: Interpretation and meaning-making of observation data (understanding and recognition)
5. **Fourth-order observation**: Observation of observation (meta-observation)

#### Third Premise: Persistence of Quantum Properties in Existence
Macroscopic objects retain quantum properties under specific conditions. This manifests when:

- **Informational Isolation Index (II)** > critical value (0.87)
- **Environmental interaction frequency (F)** < 10^-23 Hz
- **System complexity index (C)** within specific range (detailed later)

### Decoherence Suppression Mechanisms

Normally, quantum systems rapidly undergo decoherence through environmental interaction, transitioning to classical behavior. However, in our world, decoherence is suppressed through the following mechanisms:

#### 1. Active Decoherence Suppression Technology
```
Extension of Decoherence Time:
τ_d = τ_0 × exp(S/k) × (1 + αE_shield)

τ_d: Effective decoherence time
τ_0: Base decoherence time (~10^-23 seconds)
S: System information entropy
E_shield: Environmental shielding field strength
α: Technology coefficient (depends on civilization level)
```

#### 2. Generation of Informational Vacuum
By artificially creating a complete "informational vacuum," the system enters a state where it receives no external observation. This differs from physical vacuum—it's a state where information flow in and out is completely blocked.

#### 3. Reverse Utilization of Quantum Zeno Effect
Normally, frequent observation suppresses state changes in a system (Quantum Zeno Effect). In our work, we utilize this effect in reverse—maintaining the system in quantum superposition through "complete absence of observation."

## 1.2 Extension and Interpretation of the Quantum Measurement Problem

### Review of the Standard Measurement Problem

The measurement problem in quantum mechanics consists of three elements:

1. **Wave function collapse**: Discontinuous change from pre-observation superposition to post-observation definite state
2. **Role of the observer**: Does the observer (consciousness?) play a special role in physical systems?
3. **Irreversibility of measurement**: Why is observation irreversible?

### Extended Interpretation in Our Work

#### 1. Multi-layer Wave Function Model
In addition to the standard wave function Ψ, we introduce an information layer wave function Φ:

```
Total Wave Function: Ξ = Ψ ⊗ Φ

Ψ: Traditional wave function describing physical state
Φ: New wave function describing informational state
⊗: Tensor product (with special coupling rules)
```

#### 2. Principle of Observational Relativity
Observation is not absolute but depends on the relationship between observer and observed:

- **Strong observation**: When informational coupling is strong, classical wave function collapse occurs
- **Weak observation**: When coupling is weak, only partial collapse occurs
- **Zero observation**: When there's no coupling, the system maintains complete quantum state

#### 3. Informational Uncertainty Principle
An information version of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:

```
ΔI × ΔE ≥ ħ_info / 2

ΔI: Information uncertainty
ΔE: Existence uncertainty
ħ_info: Informational Planck constant (new fundamental constant)
```

### Conditions for Macroscopic Quantum Phenomena

While quantum phenomena are normally limited to microscopic scales, they can manifest at macroscopic scales when the following conditions are met:

#### 1. Transcending Critical Size
```
L_critical = λ_dB × N^(1/3) × exp(-E_binding/kT)

L_critical: Critical size
λ_dB: de Broglie wavelength
N: Number of constituent particles
E_binding: Binding energy
```

Even when system size exceeds L_critical, quantum properties are preserved through special symmetries.

#### 2. Informational Coherence Length
```
ξ_info = v_info × τ_coherence

ξ_info: Informational coherence length
v_info: Information propagation speed (≤ c)
τ_coherence: Coherence time
```

If ξ_info is larger than system size, the entire system exhibits quantum behavior.

## 1.3 Definition and Difference Between Physical Entity and "Informational Existence"

### Definition of Physical Entity

A physical entity is an existence with the following attributes:

1. **Mass-Energy**: Follows E=mc²
2. **Spacetime Occupation**: Has definite position and momentum (within uncertainty principle limits)
3. **Interaction Capability**: Interacts with other objects through four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetic, strong, weak)
4. **Conservation Law Compliance**: Follows conservation laws of energy, momentum, angular momentum, etc.

### Definition of Informational Existence

An informational existence has the following attributes in addition to physical entity properties:

1. **Information Transmission Capability**: Can transmit its state externally
2. **Information Processing Capability**: Can process received information internally
3. **Memory Retention Capability**: Can store past information
4. **Self-Recognition Capability**: Can recognize its own existence as information (only higher-order informational existences)

### Existence Classification Matrix

|  | Physical Entity Present | Physical Entity Absent |
|---|---|---|
| **Informational Existence Present** | Normal objects/life forms (Quadrant 1) | Pure information entities/AI (Quadrant 2) |
| **Informational Existence Absent** | Quantum fog state (Quadrant 3) | Complete void (Quadrant 4) |

#### Quadrant 1: Normal Existence
All objects and life forms we recognize daily. Follow both physical and informational laws.

#### Quadrant 2: Pure Information Entities
Exist as information without physical entity. Examples: Cloud-based AI, virtual reality entities.

#### Quadrant 3: Quantum Fog (Core of Our Work)
Physically exist but informationally don't exist. Without observation, have no definite state.

#### Quadrant 4: Complete Void
Neither physically nor informationally exist. True "nothingness."

### Hierarchy of Informational Existence

Informational existence has the following hierarchy:

1. **Level 0**: Simple information patterns (e.g., particle spin)
2. **Level 1**: Complex information structures (e.g., molecules, crystals)
3. **Level 2**: Dynamic information systems (e.g., weather systems, ecosystems)
4. **Level 3**: Self-aware information entities (e.g., life, consciousness)
5. **Level 4**: Meta-aware information entities (e.g., advanced intelligence, civilization)
6. **Level 5**: Quantum-information hybrids (e.g., quantum civilizations in our work)

### Phase Transitions of Existence

The following phase transitions are possible between physical entities and informational existence:

#### 1. Informatization
```
Physical Entity → Informational Existence
Condition: Complete state scanning and recording
Examples: Consciousness upload, complete digitization of objects
```

#### 2. Materialization
```
Informational Existence → Physical Entity
Condition: Transfer of information to physical substrate
Examples: Ultimate form of 3D printing, matter generation from information
```

#### 3. Quantization
```
Normal Existence → Quantum Fog
Condition: Complete observation blocking, informational isolation
Example: Core phenomenon of our work
```

#### 4. Classicalization
```
Quantum Fog → Normal Existence
Condition: Wave function collapse through observation
Example: "Discovery" of quantum civilizations
```

### Physics of Informational Existence

Informational existence follows these new physical laws:

#### 1. Information Conservation Law
```
dI/dt = 0 (in closed systems)

I: Total information of the system
```

#### 2. Information-Energy Equivalence Principle
```
E_info = k_B × T × I × ln(2)

E_info: Energy equivalent of information
k_B: Boltzmann constant
T: Temperature
I: Information quantity (bits)
```

#### 3. Informational Action Principle
```
S_info = ∫(I - U)dt

S_info: Informational action
I: Informational kinetic energy
U: Informational potential energy
```

Systems behave to minimize informational action S_info.
